# README

submissions tracking? do we need this? people often track this on their own
- no editor info for submissions - only for 
submissions tracker does need rights to each title 

things that already exist

db of authors
db of titles 
db of contracts (title can have more than one - (international north american etc))

financial reasons - what payments are coming up 
what's due soon, deadlines - etc on a dashboard of sorts


tried at foundry: 
bates has places ot put everything and does computations for you 
you put in agent and the splits each gets

run reports on who's getting paid how much and when

jess would love - jennifer asks jess to send an invoice to show Jess's comission from an autohr payment
i twould be so much easier to have one place to trun a report that prints out two things
- one for the client - $ in $ out and 
- one for agency - that details the splits for internal use
what if we had a visual page that loked like the word do
agent has a page that's prefilled - and they fill in the information and that information is pulled and put into the db

useability 

atlas is all cloud based and you can't export infomrmation

really bothers about that's rights - plugging in commission splits
jess could in theory go in and add that she gets 7.5 and jen gets 7.5 - but she doesn't want the client to see it
so she has to go back to the page and change all permissions

function that connects to bank - to actually send money through the software - still needs quickbooks
